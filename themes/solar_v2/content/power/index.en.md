The site is statically generated, so every page is a simple html file that I generate whenever I update the site. Images are dithered with [hitherdither](https://github.com/hbldh/hitherdither) to save space & power, you can choose to view the full image by clicking on the little icon in the caption.

The original Low Tech Magazine runs on solar power and is on- or offline depending its battery load! [Go check it out!](https://lowtechmagazine.com)

This website looks best in [Tiny Grotesk](https://tinytype.co/type/tiny-grotesk) by Robin Mientjes. I haven't included it to save energy but you should totally consider buying it!
